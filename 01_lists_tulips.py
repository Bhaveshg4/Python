A = [12,34,56,78]
A[2] = 0
print(A)
# IT WILL CHANGE THE SECOND CHARACTER WITH  0

B = [2,4,56,7,8]
print(B[2])   #it will print the second character of the set 
  # ([]) these are used to create a list
  # we  can also print the set using print function

  # we can create a list like
Z = [ 34, 5, " things" , 3 , 65] 
print(Z [4])

#LIST SLICING
friends =  ["roham" , "om" , "sankalp" , 45] 
print(friends[0:2])  
friends[2] = "divya"
print(friends)         # it works , we can replace , edit , slice a list as we have done in string slicing
